<h2>Latest News</h2>

<div class="news1"> <p >Forbes reports that the 129-year-old Chicago-based firm, which caters to institutional investors, corporations, and high net worth individuals, has begun 
to open up some of its services to cryptocurrency hedge funds while also exploring how to integrate blockchain technology into its private equity division.
According to the publication, Northern Trust has for months also been working with three “mainstream hedge funds” that have begun stealthily adding cryptocurrency 
investments to their portfolios as they seek to gain exposure to the nascent but burgeoning crypto marketplace.Northern Trust has an estimated $10.7 trillion in assets under 
custody and administration, according to its website. At present, Northern Trust is not custodying cryptoassets directly, but the firm is providing crypto-curious hedge funds 
and institutions with administrative services such as helping them assign values to their investments, assisting in anti-money laundering (AML) compliance, and verifying that 
the firms’ third-party custodians are holding the cryptoassets the funds report on their balance sheets. That revelation, along with the recent news that “Big Four” accounting firm 
PwC had agreed to audit the Tezos Foundation, which oversees the assets raised during the cryptocurrency’s then-record initial coin offering (ICO), is the latest sign that 
established financial services firms are recognizing that the cryptocurrency industry is a market that they can no longer dismiss.
Pete Cherecwich, Northern Trust’s president of corporate and institutional services, told Forbes that while the firm is on record stating that it is “cautious” about 
blockchain technology, it is also preparing for a future in which governments themselves may issue their state-backed currencies on a blockchain.
“I do believe that governments will ultimately look at digitizing their currencies, and having them trade kind of like a digital token — a token of the U.S. dollar — but the 
U.S. dollar is still in a vault somewhere, or backed by the government,” he said. “How are they going to do that? I don’t know. But I do believe they are going to get there.” </p>

During the past 6 months alone the value of the rupee has depreciated by 5.44% in comparison to the US Dollar. 
The rupee value which was at 110 rupees and 95 cents in comparison to the US dollar, in the year 2010, shot up to 152 
rupees and 85 cents by the beginning of 2017, it currently stands at Rs. 161.1782.
Among several factors that affect the foreign exchange rates of a country, the inflation rate as well as the country’s 
current account and the balance of payments have a major impact. The interest rates of the country also plays an important
 role in the fluctuation of the exchange rates. Experts say, under the 100 days government, during the first quarter 
of 2015, the former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran’s money printing lit the fuse under the economy.
The national debt figure in January 2015 stood at rupees 4000 billion or 4 trillion rupees. During the controversial 
bond scam on the 27th of February 2015, where bonds worth 10 billion rupees was issued for 30 years, the interest rates 
went up by 3.15%. In rupee terms this increase in interest rates translated to an additional burden of 126 billion rupees
 to the countries debt. It is clear that the money printing undertaken by the former governor of the Central Bank of 
Sri Lanka Arjuna Mahendran caused the rupee to depreciate further. Economists further pointed out that the interest rate 
increase during the 2015 bond scam sped up the rupee depreciation. If the politicians of the country are not able to manage 
the economy, should they not hand over the responsibility to others, competent and able to deliver the peoples’ 
aspirations. Why should the 22 million people of this country, tolerate the foolishness and inaptitude of legislators 
who have a clear disfunctionality and act in their own narrow interests.Former Governor of the Central Bank Arjuna Mahendran 
remains elusive. For the moment he manages to evade the long hands of the law. The Prime Minister, the man who recommended 
his appointment and gave assurances to the cabinet of ministers on his ability and skill remains tight lipped before the people.</p>
